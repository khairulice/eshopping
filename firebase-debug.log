You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  F:\Products\Excercise\react\eshopping

Before we get started, keep in mind:

  * You are initializing in an existing Firebase project directory

[info] 
=== Project Setup
[info] 
[info] First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
[info] You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add, 
[info] but for now we'll just set up a default project.
[info] 
[info] i  .firebaserc already has a default project, skipping
[info] 
=== Database Setup
[info] 
[info] Firebase Realtime Database Rules allow you to define how your data should be
[info] structured and when your data can be read from and written to.
[info] 
[info] Skipping overwrite of Database Rules.
[info] The rules defined in database.rules.json will be published when you do firebase deploy.
[info] 
=== Firestore Setup

[info] requests. You can keep these rules in your project directory
[info] and publish them with firebase deploy.
[info] 
[info] 
[info] Firestore indexes allow you to perform complex queries while
[info] maintaining performance that scales with the size of the result
[info] set. You can keep index definitions in your project directory
[info] and publish them with firebase deploy.
[info] 
[info] 
=== Functions Setup
[info] 
[info] A functions directory will be created in your project with a Node.js
[info] package pre-configured. Functions can be deployed with firebase deploy.
